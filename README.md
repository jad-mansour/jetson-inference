# Jetson for Inference

Welcome to the **jetson-inference** repository! This repository serves as compilation for all things Jetson, ranging from flashing to compiling libraries from source and providing our own precompiled libraries.
Due to missing documentation online, we aim to provide extra information about the Jetson platforms which includes version incompatibilities and workarounds.

**Please have a look at the Wiki for detailed tutorials and tips.**
